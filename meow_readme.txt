Welcome to Meowpocalypse: The Quest for a Happy Cat

Mr. Meow is your best friend and room mate.  After coming home from work, though, you can see that something is troubling him. You win the game by
helping Mr. Meow return to happiness.  You'll know he's maximally happy when he curls up on your lap and purrs.

As you find the things that make for a less-than-optimal cat environment, Mr. Meow’s happiness will increase.  You can get a general sense of his well-being by using the ‘look’ command (see below).

Interacting:

You can type your actions in complete sentences and using upper or lower case and punctuation.  You can also use ‘short form’ commands.
    e.g. “Look at Mr. Meow” (long form) or ‘look meow’ (short form) 

Spelling matters!

Commands:

‘look’ – You need to ‘look’ at an object, at Mr. Meow (aka ‘cat’), or at the room you are in.  Many objects have clues to their uses in their description.  Not all objects play a significant role in the game, however.

‘i’ or ‘inventory’ – will display a list of the objects currently in your possession.

‘take’ – If you ‘take’ an object, it will be added to your inventory and you can interact with it  or, possibly, use it to complete a task.  Not all objects can be picked up!

‘drop’ – If an item is in your inventory, you can drop it in the room you’re currently in.  It will stay there until you come back for it.

‘use’ – a few objects can be used to accomplish a task.

‘give’ – One object in the game can be given to Mr. Meow

‘put’ – Some things can be combined to make them more useful.

‘where’ – If you type “where is [object]”, that object’s current location will be shown.  You still have to go to that room to use it.

‘where am I?’ – If you’ve forgotten which room you’re in, this will reveal the answer.  

‘go’ – You can ‘go’ to any other room in the apartment.

‘sit’ – There is one object in which you can sit.  Which one should be fairly obvious…

‘pet’ – You can pet Mr. Meow
